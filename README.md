  <li><u>Simple Recommender (Popularity Based)</u> :
    <p>It offers <b>generalized recommendations to every user</b> based on movie popularity and (sometimes) genre. The basic idea behind this recommender is that movies that are <b>more popular and more critically acclaimed</b> will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. This model <b>does not give personalized recommendations</b> based on the user.<p>
  </li>
  <li><u>Content-Based Recommmender</u> :
    <p>These filtering methods are <b>based on the description of an item and a profile of the user’s preferred choices</b>. Here keywords are used to describe the items and a user profile is built to state the type of item this user likes. In other words, the algorithms try to <b>recommend products which are similar</b> to the ones that a user has liked in the past.<p>
  </li>
  <li><u>Demograhic Recommender System</u> :
    <p>It is usually <b>based on collecting and analyzing information on user’s behaviors</b>, their activities or preferences and predicting <b>what they will like based on the similarity with other users</b>. A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it <b>does not rely on machine analyzable content</b> and thus it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an “understanding” of the item itself.<p>
