  <li><b>Simple Recommender (Popularity Based)</b> :
    <p>It offers <b>generalized recommendations to every user</b> based on movie popularity and (sometimes) genre. The basic idea behind this recommender is that movies that are <b>more popular and more critically acclaimed</b> will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. This model <b>does not give personalized recommendations</b> based on the user.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Content-Based Recommmender</b> :
    <p>These filtering methods are <b>based on the description of an item and a profile of the user’s preferred choices</b>. Here keywords are used to describe the items and a user profile is built to state the type of item this user likes. In other words, the algorithms try to <b>recommend products which are similar</b> to the ones that a user has liked in the past.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Demograhic Recommender System</b> :
    <p><b>This system aims to categorize the users based on attributes and make recommendations based on demographic classes</b>. In Demographic-based recommender system the algorithms first need a proper market research in the specified region accompanied with a short survey to gather data for categorization. Demographic techniques form “people-to-people” correlations like collaborative ones, but use different data. The benefit of a demographic approach is that it <b>does not require a history of user ratings</b> like that in collaborative and content based recommender systems. <b>It is not that complex and easy to implement.</b></p>
